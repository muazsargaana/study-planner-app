# Study Planner App

A web-based study planner app built with **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS** to help students manage tasks, schedules, and track their study progress.

This project was originally developed as my **Major Design Project (MDP)** for **HSC Design and Technology**, where I created a tool to help high school students organise their study time, reduce procrastination, and track academic progress.  

I am currently studying **Software Engineering** and plan to pursue a career in **Machine Learning**, and this project reflects my interest in building practical software solutions while developing my programming skills.

## Features

- **Task management:** Add, edit, and delete study tasks.  
- **Calendar scheduling:** Plan study sessions and deadlines.  
- **Progress tracking:** Monitor completion of tasks and overall study progress.  
- **Customizable interface:** Designed with a clean, user-friendly UI.  

## Technologies

- **HTML** – structure and content of the app  
- **CSS** – styling and responsive design  
- **JavaScript** – functionality and interactive features

## Future Goals

I plan to continue improving my programming skills and exploring **Machine Learning**, building more complex projects that combine software development and data analysis.
